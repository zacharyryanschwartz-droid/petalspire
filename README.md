# Petalspire v0.31

A cozy 3D flower-garden prototype for iPhone Safari (portrait, one thumb). Also plays on desktop with a mouse.
This is a **prototype**: version numbers stay below 1.0 until the first official release.

**Play:** https://zacharyryanschwartz-droid.github.io/petalspire/

## v0.3 loop
1. **The woods.** Tap trees to chop them (+3 Wood), then tap the stumps (+1 Wood). About 1 in 5 obstacles hides a **find**: a sparkle appears where it stood, and you tap it to pick it up. Trees sometimes drop a **sapling**.
2. **Finds** (Bag → Finds). Each find can be **Restored** for a small cost and some waiting time (20–45 s, or 1 Jewel to finish now) or **Recycled** for Wood, coins or Scrap.
   - 10 kinds. Restored decor (planter, lantern, bench, gnome, trellis, bottle chime, weathervane) can be placed on your land and raises **atmosphere**, which brings customers sooner.
   - Watering Can: faster water. Wheelbarrow: +1 Wood per tree. Old Crate: +4 stand shelf.
3. **Raised beds.** Build → Raised bed (12 Wood). The first bed brings the rain barrel and a Starter Seed Pack, so water can never run out.
4. **Build it yourself.**
   - After your first bed, a glowing **Farm Stand blueprint** appears by the road. It costs 15 Wood; adding an Old Crate is optional. A scaffold rises, sawdust flies, and the stand is done.
   - The **Drying Rack** (10 Wood) becomes buildable after your first Heartvine harvest.
   - The Build menu lists every structure with its cost and whether it is locked.
5. **Rebuild the Supply Market.** Once you've earned 100 coins at the stand, the boarded-up market can be rebuilt for 30 Wood + 60 coins (3 Scrap saves 20 coins). It goes boarded → scaffold (60 s, or 2 Jewels) → open. It sells seeds, water, garden features, Card Packs, a **bundle of 5 Wood (12 coins)** and **saplings (20 coins)**.
6. **Grow trees.** Plant a sapling on cleared ground you own (not in beds). It grows through four stages over **40 minutes of real time**, and keeps growing while the game is closed. Chop a mature tree for 6 Wood; it leaves a stump (+1) and has a 50% chance to drop a new sapling.
7. **Land for sale.** Five wooded plots, each with a floating For Sale sign: 150 → 300 → 600 → 1000 → 1500 coins.

Drag with one finger to pan, pinch to zoom, and twist with two fingers to turn. On desktop, right-drag or shift-drag turns the view.

## New in v0.31
- **Shade slows growth.** Every standing tree (wild, planted or the background woods) and every building (stand, market, rack) casts shade in a circle around it. Bigger and closer casters shade more, and casters on the golden-hour (north-west) side count most. Stumps cast none.
  - Model: `shade = Σ weight · (1 − dist/reach)^1.3 · (0.4 + 0.6 · sunSide)`, clamped to 0–100%; `sun = 1 − shade`.
  - Growth speed = 25% + 75% × sun, so **full shade grows 4× slower**. This applies to bed plants and saplings, and to offline catch-up.
  - Shaded tiles get a soft dappled overlay. Tile and tree info shows "Sun: 40% · growing slower", and the Build preview labels every patch with its Sun %.
  - Shade is recomputed whenever a tree is chopped, planted or grows a stage, or a building or bed is placed. Progress is kept and only the remaining time stretches or shrinks.
  - All numbers live in `SHADE` in `js/data.js`.
- **Rain barrel refills 1 water per minute** (was 1 per 20 s), cap 10, including while the game is closed. The Brass Watering Can halves that to 30 s and raises the cap to 15.
- **Irrigation card** (Uncommon feature, 45 coins in the Supply Market once pulled from a Card Pack). Tap the card in Bag → Garden features, then tap a raised bed. A drip hose runs from the rain barrel to that bed, and the bed waters its thirsty plants by itself, using 1 barrel water per plant. When the barrel is empty it pauses until it refills. Each card covers one bed, so more cards cover more beds. Offline catch-up waters plants at the barrel's 1-per-minute pace.

## Jewels, ads and settings (prototype, no real money)
- **Jewel Shop:** opens from the Jewel counter, the Bag or the Market.
  - Bundles: 1 for $0.99, 10 for $6.99, 50 for $29.99 (Best value).
  - **No More Ads + 10 Jewels** costs $8.99. It removes the banner and partner ads and then shows as Owned.
  - Purchases are **simulated**: a "Prototype: purchase simulated, no charge" confirm appears, then the items are granted. `PAYMENTS_MODE` in `js/data.js` is the single switch (`'simulated'`, or a future `'apple-iap'` bridge in `js/payments.js`).
- **Ads (placeholders, no ad SDK):**
  - The bottom banner is a **house ad** for our own games. Right now that's *Market Plot, coming soon*; tapping it opens Settings → Play Other Games. It sits below the tab bar, and the UI moves up to make room.
  - **Partner ad** interstitials appear after every 3rd sale and after opening a bought Card Pack, at most once per 90 s. They can be skipped after 3 s.
  - An opt-in "watch an ad for +10 coins" placeholder is at the stand (3 min cooldown).
  - `ADS_MODE` and `ADS` in `js/data.js` control all of this. `ADS.partner` is the hook for a future partner SDK.
- **Settings** (gear icon) contains:
  - Play Other Games: a list driven by `OTHER_GAMES` in `js/data.js`.
  - Ad status.
  - Show tips again.
  - Reset garden.

Progress autosaves to localStorage (`petalspire.v03`; v0.31 uses the same save, and plants already growing in a v0.3 save keep their progress). v0.2 saves are migrated automatically: your beds, stand, rack, market, land and coins are kept, plus a gift of a sapling and 3 Jewels. The old save is kept as a backup.

## Tech
Plain HTML/CSS/ES modules with no build step. Three.js r170 is vendored in `vendor/`. All 3D meshes are procedural low-poly, made in code.
- `js/layout.js`: lots, bed sites and obstacle placement (seeded, so the same for everyone)
- `js/world.js`: the scene, camera, picking, chopping, cars, build animations, blueprints, finds, decor and growing trees
- `js/data.js`: costs, timings, finds, bundles, ad config
- `js/main.js`: game state, goals, panels, the stand and customers, and the card reveal
- `js/payments.js`, `js/ads.js`: the swappable purchase and ad layers
- `js/shade.js`: the shade model (pure functions)

Run it locally with `python3 -m http.server` and open http://localhost:8000. Add `?treeMin=1` to make trees grow in 1 minute when testing.
